# EvanPack
This is the Evan Pack by Evan. This pack is an addon to the Faithful texture pack (https://faithfulpack.net/downloads) and will not run properly without it. Put the Evan Pack above Faithful in the resource pack selector.

Requires fancy graphics on.
Requires Optifine or Optifine Alternatives for Fabric (https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/). You will need Continuity, CIT Resewn, Custom Entity Models, and Entity Texture Features (Iris Shaders Recommended)

For bugs and issues, report them in the issues section with the title format "MCversion EPversion issue" (ex "1.18 v1.0 sheep texture broken"). In the comment, describe the issue and any relevant information including probable causes and possible solutions.
